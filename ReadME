Maize Leaf Disease Classification - Cognitive Computing Exam
Project Overview
This Jupyter notebook performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a maize leaf disease dataset containing four classes of plant conditions. The project is designed for a cognitive computing exam and focuses on analyzing class distribution imbalances to inform data preprocessing decisions for building a disease classification model.

Dataset Structure
The dataset is organized in Google Drive with the following directory structure:

text
/data
  ├── Common_Rust/ (1,306 images)
  ├── Healthy/ (1,162 images)
  ├── Gray_Leaf_Spot/ (574 images)
  └── Blight/ (1,146 images)
Total Images: 4,188 across all classes

Class Imbalance Issue: The dataset shows a significant imbalance with Gray_Leaf_Spot having only 574 images compared to other classes (1,000+ images). This imbalance will be addressed through data augmentation techniques in subsequent preprocessing steps.

Key Features
1. Google Drive Integration
Mounts Google Drive to access the dataset stored in /content/drive/MyDrive/Cognitive_Computing_Exam/data

Uses google.colab.drive.mount() for seamless file access within the Colab environment

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Class Distribution Analysis: Counts and displays the number of images per disease class

Visualization: Creates bar charts showing the imbalance between classes

Sample Image Display: Shows example images from each disease category for visual inspection and quality assessment

3. Technical Implementation
Prepares for TensorFlow's ImageDataGenerator implementation (imported but not yet fully implemented)

Employs matplotlib for data visualization and analysis

Utilizes Python's os and collections modules for file system operations and counting

Setup Instructions
Prerequisites
Google Colab environment

Google Drive account with the dataset uploaded to the specified path

Running the Notebook
Open the notebook in Google Colab

Run the first cell to mount Google Drive (you'll need to grant access permissions)

Execute subsequent cells in order to:

Load and analyze class distributions

Visualize the data imbalance using bar charts

Display sample images from each class for quality assessment

Key Observations
Severe Class Imbalance:

Gray_Leaf_Spot class has approximately 50% fewer images than other classes

This imbalance could bias the model if not addressed

Dataset Characteristics:

Total of 4,188 images across four classes

Clear visual distinctions between disease types are visible in sample images

Data Quality:

Images appear to be properly labeled and organized

Visual inspection shows identifiable disease characteristics

Next Steps
Based on the EDA findings, the following steps are recommended:

Data Preprocessing:

Implement data augmentation for the underrepresented Gray_Leaf_Spot class

Use TensorFlow's ImageDataGenerator with augmentation techniques

Consider oversampling or synthetic data generation for balanced training

Model Development:

Prepare the dataset for model training

Split data into training, validation, and test sets

Develop CNN architecture for disease classification

Evaluation:

Use appropriate metrics considering class imbalance (F1-score, precision, recall)

Implement cross-validation techniques

Dependencies
The notebook requires the following Python libraries:

google.colab (for Colab-specific functionality)

tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image (for image data generators)

os (for file system operations)

collections.Counter (for counting class distributions)

matplotlib.pyplot (for data visualization)
